# AlphaCapture Strategy

This project involves the collection, analysis, and modeling of financial data to develop a trading strategy using machine learning techniques. The main objectives are to gather historical stock data, engineer features, generate trading signals using a machine learning model, backtest the strategy, evaluate performance metrics, optimize the model, and implement risk management techniques.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:
- `yfinance`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

## Data Collection
The project collects historical stock data using the yfinance library.

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves creating relevant features from the raw stock data to be used as inputs for the machine learning model.

## Model Training
The project uses a RandomForestClassifier to generate trading signals. Then we use a stacking classifier with XGBoost and Logistic Regression as the final estimator to achieve the best results.

## Backtesting
The backtesting process evaluates the performance of the trading strategy on historical data. It includes calculating key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Optimization and Risk Management
The model optimization process includes tuning hyperparameters and implementing risk management techniques to improve the strategy's performance.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques in developing a trading strategy. The workflow includes data collection, feature engineering, model training, backtesting, optimization, and risk management.
